Three Card Monte is a popular street scam wherein three cards (two black 7s and the Queen of Hearts) are shuffled in front of an observer as they keep track of the Queen of Hearts. At the end, the observer bets that they can correctly pick out the Queen of Hearts and almost always loses because of some sneaky sleight of hand by the dealer.
This game has a similar objective as Three Card Monte (finding the Queen of Hearts). However, the twist is that the card is somewhere in a derieve of webpages and the player has to overcome some challenges to find it. This game draws inspiration not only from Three Card Monte but also from IQ test apps which, although nowhere close to real IQ tests, have some interesting lateral thinking questions requiring out of the box interaction with the app. This game is similar. Explore and have fun!

Here is the solution:-
1) Click the "of" in "Find the Queen of Hearts:-" and you will be directed to Phase 1.
2) Return to the home page and retrieve values from the three cards by repeatedly clicking on them until a value is seen. (Value = Card value)
Key1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
3) Hover the mouse over the bottom left of the screen and a link saying "Into the unknown" should become visible which when clicked will direct you to a page with three question mark buttons.
4) Click on the first question mark and the "here" in "She is not here" is a hyperlink to Phase 2.
5) The answer to Phase 2 is 21 (base 7 arithmetic) => Key2 = 21
6) Go back to home page and hover mouse over bottom right of the screen. Another link saying "Into the unknown" should become visible.
7) Click on it and the 6th card in the 3rd row is the link to Phase 3.
8) Click on the text "Phase 3".
9) Key 3 = 21 / 3 = 7. So click on "G". If you click on incorrect letters thrice, you will lose (redirected to the loss screen).
10) The 3rd link from the top on the right will direct you to the Queen of Hearts. Clicking on incorrect links thrice will make you lose.
11) Click on the Queen of Hearts to win the game (you will be redirected to the win screen).
